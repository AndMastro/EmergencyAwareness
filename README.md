# Emergency Awareness On Social Media
# Web Information Retrieval Project

The aim of our project1 is the categorization
of disater-related tweets. Our work
is divided into 3 tasks. Firstly, we classify
disaster-related tweets into predefined
classes, based on the work by (Stowe et
al., 2016). Secondly, we perform bursts
detection (Fung et al., 2005) in order to
understand which tweets are more likely
to be related to hazard events and finally,
among those tweets, we perform an online
clustering in order to gather tweets into
groups, basing this part on the paper by
(Yin et al., 2012). The results of classification
and clustering can be used by emergency
managers to understand how people
are reacting during a disaster situation in
order take proper actions both during and
after the emergency.
